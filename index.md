 --------------------
 ### Educational Background
 **School of Electronic Science and Engineering, Nanjing University(NJU)**
 
*09/2018 - 06/2022*

- Major: Telecommunications Engineering
- Academic: Top student of my major; 3/205 in the second year.
 



-------------------------
### Research Experience
**Security Check based on Terahertz Image**  

*01/2021-now; Institute of Communication Technology, Nanjing University*

*Dircetor: Yechao Bai (Associate Professor)*

- Constructed a stacked autoencoder to distinguish dangerous goods from terahertz images.


**Spectrum Sensing Project**    

*03/2020 - 09/2020; Institute of Communication Technology, Nanjing University*

*Director: Yechao Bai (Associate Professor)*

- Designed an interactive interface with Matlab GUI to display and visualize real-time transmitted data.
- Built a spectrum database with MySQL. 
- The work adopted distributed collaborative perception to detect the idle frequency bands in a given frequency range.


**Acoustic Standing Wave Demonstration System**

*10/2019 - 12/2020*

*Advisor: Jiang Zheng (Senior Engineer)*

- Implemented a high-precision A/D conversion circuit using ADC0809 chip with Verilog HDL  and Vivado software.
- Constructed the sonic standing wave demonstration system on the Basys3 board.
- Utilize ping-pong cache mechanism to design the data processing module.

-----------------
### Course Projects
**Digital Image Watermark Algorithm against Geometric Attacks; Cryptography**

*01/2021*

- Generate digital image watermarks with the zero-watermark method to protect image copyrights.
- The scrambled meaningful watermark and the feature vector extracted from the original picture are XORed and registered as copyright information.
- Added NMF matrix decomposition to make the watermark resistant to geometric attacks and increase robustness.


**Implement a Beauty Software; Digital image processing**

*11/2020*

- Adopted a variety of image processing methods and machine learning methods to achieve functions such as microdermabrasion, wrinkle removal, and background replacement. 


**Smart Clothes Drying Rod Device; Sensor principle**

*08/2020*

- Implemented the wind speed detection module with Hall sensor.
- Input the detection results of various sensor modules into the single-chip microcomputer, and use the motor drive device.


 **Monte Carlo Integration Method and Paradox Problems about Probability**
 
 *06/2020*
 
 - The Monte Carlo method relies on repeated random experiments to obtain results. I use it to calculate the definite integral and compare it with the result of direct calculation and improve it.
 - I collected, analyzed and classified 9 typical paradox problems in probability theory, and explored the reasons of the paradoxes and tried to put forward methods to avoid them.


 **Implementation of a Network Application**
 
 *04/2020*
 
 - Implementation an chat room based on the socket communication mechanism, and transform it into a stand-alone chat room with shared memory and semaphore mechanism.
